# Heart Disease Prediction Model ðŸ©ºðŸ’“

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning model for predicting heart disease risk based on various medical attributes. The model is trained on a dataset containing patient information such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, etc. It utilizes a sophisticated algorithm to analyze these features and provide predictions.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Algorithm:** Utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.
- **Web Deployment:** Hosted on Heroku for easy access.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive interface for inputting patient data.

## Deployment Trial
This project serves as a trial to expose a machine learning model to the web, enabling users to interact with it locally using Heroku. By deploying the model on Heroku, we aim to make it accessible to a wider audience and gather valuable feedback for future improvements.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Programming language for model development.
- **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning library for model training.
- **Flask:** Micro web framework for building the web application.
- **HTML:** Markup language for designing the user interface.
- **Pickled Machine Learning:** Serialization technique for saving and loading machine learning models.

## Usage
1. **Input Data:** Enter patient information including age, sex, cholesterol levels, etc.
2. **Prediction:** Get instant predictions on the risk of heart disease.
3. **Feedback:** Users can provide feedback to improve the model's accuracy over time.
